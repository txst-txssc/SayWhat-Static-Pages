          <p>The Center for Disease Control and Prevention recognizes the importance of <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/stateandcommunity/bp_userguide_youth/pdfs/youth_engagement.pdf">the role that youth play</a> in a comprehensive tobacco control program.</p>
          
          <p>The Texas Department of State Health Services also recognizes the role that young people play in making lasting, environmental changes concerning tobacco prevention and control. Under their direction, the Texas School Safety Center has designed the 2012 Say What! Texas Tobacco-Free Conference to be the first ever, 100% youth focused tobacco prevention and control conference in the state of Texas.</p>
          
          <p>We are dedicated to bringing new, cutting edge strategies, information, tools, techniques concerning youth leadership and prevention to pass along to you. If you are part of a youth group working on tobacco-free policy, prevention related issues or other projects in your school or community, we invite you to join us for the elite training opportunity.</p>

          <p>Have you read the latest Surgeon General’s report on <a href="http://www.surgeongeneral.gov/library/preventing-youth-tobacco-use/full-report.pdf">Preventing Tobacco Use Among Youth and Young Adults</a>? What about the Center for Disease Control and Prevention User Guide for <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/stateandcommunity/bp_userguide_youth/pdfs/youth_engagement.pdf">Youth Engagement: State and Community Interventions Category</a>?</p>
          
          <p>Did you know that Texas only spends 2% of what the Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends we spend on tobacco prevention, which ranks the state as number 39 in the nation? Or that the tobacco industry spends $622.4 million to advertise their deadly product in our great state alone?</p>
          
          <p>Despite the huge setback in funding and advertising, 78.8% of Texas high school students choose NOT to smoke. That’s right, not everyone is doing it!</p>
          
          <p>These great topics will be covered at the 2012 Say What! Conference:</p>
