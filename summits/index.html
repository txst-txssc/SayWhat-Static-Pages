              <p>Informational sessions are based on the latest research released by national partners in tobacco control and prevention, but are developed with the input of, and delivered by, the Texas Teen Ambassadors to ensure that the information is relevant to youth and young adults today and easy to comprehend.</p>

                  <p>The Surgeon General's Office has released several reports in recent years concerning environmental prevention strategies that focus on tobacco.</p>

                  <p>A few of the highlights include:</p>

                  <ul>
                    <li>50% of White and Hispanic male tobacco users between ages 12 and 17, report use of more than one tobacco product</li>
                    <li>88% of adult daily cigarette smokers began smoking before the age of 18 and 99% first use before 26</li>
                    <li>Smokeless tobacco use among White males and cigar smoking among Black females has actually increased</li>
                    <li>A combination of mass media campaigns, price increases (including those from tax increases), school-based policies and programs and statewide or community-wide changes in smoke free policies and norms are the most effective combination for reducing initiation, prevalence and intensity of smoking among youth.</li>
                  </ul>
                  
                  <p class="cite"><i>* from <a href="http://www.surgeongeneral.gov/library/reports/preventing-youth-tobacco-use/index.html">Preventing Tobacco Use Among Youth and Young Adults: A Report of the Surgeon General</a></i></p>

                  <ul>
                    <li>Secondhand smoke causes premature death and disease in children and adults who do not smoke</li>
                    <li>There is no risk-free level of exposure to secondhand smoke</li>
                    <li>More than 50 cancer-causing agents have been identified in secondhand smoke</li>
                    <li>Establishing smoke-free workplaces is the only effective way to ensure that secondhand smoke exposure does not occur in the workplace</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p class="cite"><i>* from <a href="http://www.surgeongeneral.gov/library/reports/secondhandsmoke/index.html">The Health Consequences of Involuntary Exposure to Tobacco Smoke: A Report of the Surgeon General</a></i></p>

                  <ul>
                    <li>Sustained use and long-term exposure to tobacco smoke are due to the powerfully addicting effects of tobacco products</li>
                    <li>Changing cigarette designs (including filtered, "light" and low-tar variations) does not reduce overall disease risk</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p class="cite"><i>* from <a href="http://www.surgeongeneral.gov/library/reports/tobaccosmoke/index.html">How Tobacco Smoke Causes Disease: a Report of the Surgeon General</a></i></p>

                  <p>These findings will help guide the information delivered to students at the 2013 Say What! Summits as well as aid in developing specific plans of action to combat these issues in local communities and on a statewide level.</p>
